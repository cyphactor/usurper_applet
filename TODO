- Add controls to make sure that the num cards to quiz per set can never
  be more than the actual number of cards in the selected set. This may
  be best done by once a set is selected automatically check if it is
  more than it is, and if so reduce the max of the field to the max size
  of the set.

- Implement the creation of a random subset of the currently select card
  set the size of "Num Cards to Quiz". This should be pretty trivial. If
  I malloc() enough space for "Num Cards to Quiz" * sizeof(int) then I
  can iterate through and create a random number for each index ranging
  from 0 to (num_cards_in_cur_set - 1). After building adding the code
  to build this array I should add code to the quiz() function to use
  this array of indexes rather than looping through the entire card set
  from front to back.

  ex:
  rand_index = rand() % up_lim; /* random int in range [0,up_lim) */

  This should be intelligent random selection in that it tracks what
  values it has already chosen and will not select the same value more
  than once in each random subset.

  This creates a new restriction that the random subsets can only ever
  be smaller (or as large) as the actual set of cards.

- Add code that when the applet is start checks to see if ~/.usurper and
  ~/.usurper/card_sets exist, if not then it should create them.

- Add support for editing of cards, this will probably consist of
  keeping individual tex files around for each card (using the same
  naming scheme as the pdfs might be smart). Then just in place produce
  pdf files. Rather than using /tmp/ as I currently am. This would allow
  me to go back and incrementally go through the cards and allow the
  user to select cards to edit. Using the thumbnail capability of the
  lib popple may provide for a nice interface for doing this (but
  probably not do to scaling issues. It would prob be better to just
  display the cards scaled to 100% (which is hard enough to read).
